These two Palantir mission sheets for Crenshaw and Slauson (marked by LAPD as both a LASER zone and Anchor Point) told police to look for a ""robbery suspect"" described only as male black ages 16 to 18 whose MO was ""uses gun or bodily force to take money & jewelry."" That description could not be vaguer, but this mission generated 103 stops in a one week period followed by another 58 stops in 6 days.

Nipsey Hussle, whose Marathon Clothing store was located at this same corner, said in a 2013 interview: ""We got police in our area called gang police that, like, they'd come through and get to know you, you know what I'm saying? They'd come hop out, ask you questions, take your name, your address, your cell phone number, your social, when you ain't done nothing. Just so they know everybody in the hood.""

Chesapeake Apartments (4616 West Rodeo Road),Southwest,chesapeake_mission_sheet.jpg,https://recordsrequest.lacity.org/documents/1923173/download ,"LAPD's mission sheets often helped lay the data-driven policing groundwork for CNAP prosecutions. This Southwest Division mission sheet for the 425-unit Chesapeake Apartments in Baldwin Hills is from one week before the City Attorney filed a CNAP lawsuit against the apartment complex's owner, describing it as an ""alleged stronghold for the Black P-Stones street gang."" The Palantir mission sheet directs police to target ""BPS gang areas"" and states that ""heavy pedestrian and traffic enforcement gang members belonging to this gang is encouraged."" The recap lists 105 stops, 21 arrests, and 8 field interview cards during a one week period. 

When the CNAP complaint was filed the next week, the City Attorney asked the judge to order “the establishment of extensive security systems at the property with direct access by the Los Angeles Police Department to these systems of monitoring and surveillance.” These CNAP-compelled surveillance systems expand LAPD’s vast architecture of surveillance, which includes fusion centers, facial recognition, and other data-mining initiatives.

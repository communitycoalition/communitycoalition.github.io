                  Elaborate ideologies and attendant practices are required – before, during, and after.”

                The Stop LAPD Spying Coalition is a grassroots organization rooted in the Skid Row community on
                Gabrielino/Tongva
                land –
                stolen territory now known as Los Angeles. Over the past decade, our work has built grassroots power to
                dismantle
                LAPD
                surveillance and fight for a world without policing. This research brief offers a preview of Stop LAPD
                Spying’s
                organizing against the relationships between policing, surveillance, and real estate development. While more
                and
                more
                people are beginning to understand the role of data in policing, less attention is paid to data-driven
                policing’s
                relationship to settler colonialism and conquest. The document is not meant to be an exhaustive overview of
                this
                topic.
                Rather, our goal is to frame a broader research and organizing agenda
              </p>
              <p>
                We know from our organizing against data-driven policing that cruelty, banishment, and dispossession are not
                just
                policing’s side effects: they are the purpose. These programs incorporate tactics honed during European
                violence
                and
                genocide against indigenous populations in early America as well as enslavement of African people. The U.S.
                military
                then continued to test and unleash these tactics on occupied populations in the Philippines, Viet Nam, Central
                America,
                Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. LAPD fuses those military and imperial counterinsurgency methods with the
                anti-Black
                subordination of “broken windows” policing, stop-and-frisk, the “zero tolerance” Safer Cities Initiative in
                Skid
                Row,
                the Suspicious Activity Reporting spy program, Metro Units “proactively” hunting people across South Central
                Los
                Angeles, and gang injunctions and databases. “Predictive” and “data-driven” policing are just the latest form
                of
                those
                harms. The purposes remain the same: speculatively criminalizing our identities, banishing us from our
                communities, and
                gathering “intelligence” to control us
              </p>
              <p>
                Our research on the relationship between data-driven policing and land grew out of our years of organizing
                against
                LAPD’s first-generation of predictive policing tactics. In 2018, we published <a href="#fn1" id="r1">Before
                  the
                  Bullet Hits the Body:
                  Dismantling Predictive Policing in Los Angeles <sup>[1]</sup></a>. This report is where we shared about LAPD
                targeting members of our
                communities as “tumors” to be “surgically” removed. As we were finishing that report, we began receiving
                through
                Public
                Records Act requests maps and other official documentation of LAPD’s predictive policing “hotspot” zones. We
                knew
                we
                needed to study more about the operation of these hotspots as well as the ideologies that shaped them. We
                asked:
                what is
                the relationship between policing and capitalism? The answer to that question begins with the process that has
                always
                bound those two forces: colonization.

                The Stop LAPD Spying Coalition is a grassroots organization rooted in the Skid Row community on
                Gabrielino/Tongva
                land –
                stolen territory now known as Los Angeles. Over the past decade, our work has built grassroots power to
                dismantle
                LAPD
                surveillance and fight for a world without policing. This research brief offers a preview of Stop LAPD
                Spying’s
                organizing against the relationships between policing, surveillance, and real estate development. While more
                and
                more
                people are beginning to understand the role of data in policing, less attention is paid to data-driven
                policing’s
                relationship to settler colonialism and conquest. The document is not meant to be an exhaustive overview of
                this
                topic.
                Rather, our goal is to frame a broader research and organizing agenda
              </p>
              <p>
                We know from our organizing against data-driven policing that cruelty, banishment, and dispossession are not
                just
                policing’s side effects: they are the purpose. These programs incorporate tactics honed during European
                violence
                and
                genocide against indigenous populations in early America as well as enslavement of African people. The U.S.
                military
                then continued to test and unleash these tactics on occupied populations in the Philippines, Viet Nam, Central
                America,
                Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. LAPD fuses those military and imperial counterinsurgency methods with the
                anti-Black
                subordination of “broken windows” policing, stop-and-frisk, the “zero tolerance” Safer Cities Initiative in
                Skid
                Row,
                the Suspicious Activity Reporting spy program, Metro Units “proactively” hunting people across South Central
                Los
                Angeles, and gang injunctions and databases. “Predictive” and “data-driven” policing are just the latest form
                of
                those
                harms. The purposes remain the same: speculatively criminalizing our identities, banishing us from our
                communities, and
                gathering “intelligence” to control us
              </p>
              <p>
                Our research on the relationship between data-driven policing and land grew out of our years of organizing
                against
                LAPD’s first-generation of predictive policing tactics. In 2018, we published <a href="#fn1" id="r1">Before
                  the
                  Bullet Hits the Body:
                  Dismantling Predictive Policing in Los Angeles <sup>[1]</sup></a>. This report is where we shared about LAPD
                targeting members of our
                communities as “tumors” to be “surgically” removed. As we were finishing that report, we began receiving
                through
                Public
                Records Act requests maps and other official documentation of LAPD’s predictive policing “hotspot” zones. We
                knew
                we
                needed to study more about the operation of these hotspots as well as the ideologies that shaped them. We
                asked:
                what is
                the relationship between policing and capitalism? The answer to that question begins with the process that has
                always
                bound those two forces: colonization.
              </p>
              <p>Our study of the ideologies and institutions that surround predictive policing led to <a
                  href="https://stoplapdspying.medium.com/the-algorithmic-ecology-an-abolitionist-tool-for-organizing-against-algorithms-14fcbd0e64d0"
                  target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Algorithmic Ecology</a>, created in partnership with the activist group Free
                Radicals. 
                <img class="graphic-large" src="assets/img/landing-graphic.jpeg">
                The project began because we were researching whether &ldquo;hotspots&rdquo;&nbsp; had any connection to
                LAPD&rsquo;s murder of our Skid Row neighbor Charley "Africa" Kuenang. As we dove deeper, we uncovered an ecology of
                institutions and actors who helped create or utilize the algorithms to advance police violence, including real estate
                developers, advocacy nonprofits, academic researchers, various local, state, and federal agencies, and even the U.S.
                military. Each of those institutions shows up in the pages that follow.</p>

                <p>Our primary goal here is storytelling, voicing our people&rsquo;s reality. This research was a journey of collective
                  study and storytelling, not trying to prove a hypothesis. At the same time data-mining supercharges the ability of
                  police to stalk, target, and harm people, it also obfuscates the role of different institutions and actors in police
                  violence. Data also helps obfuscate the purpose. Sometimes the purpose is banishment: removing us from our homes and
                  communities in order to take the land. Sometimes it&rsquo;s containment: restricting us from the areas that police
                  want to secure for development. Sometimes it's extraction: exploiting our wealth, labor, or resources. And sometimes
                  it&rsquo;s elimination: killing or incarcerating our people. Whatever the purpose, what links these practices is the
                  process of conquest.</p>

                  <p>LAPD&rsquo;s different tactics and technologies today extend those various purposes. Predictive policing programs
                    serve as tools of ethnic cleansing, as well as containing and controlling communities like Skid Row. LAPD&rsquo;s role
                    as an enforcement arm of landlords is analogous to the relationship of the U.S. military to land speculators and
                    entrepreneurs in the era of genocidal western expansion. And &ldquo;community policing&rdquo; programs apply
                    counterinsurgency tactics that have been used to suppress resistance and cultivate false legitimacy in imperial
                    occupations. Throughout those examples, Los Angeles can be seen as a <em>garrison state</em>, with police testing new
                    forms of surveillance and harm on our people. These examples should have resonance beyond Los Angeles, since LAPD has
                    long been at the avant garde of white supremacy, pioneering new forms of oppression for its peers to adopt.</p>

                    <p>The rest of this report is divided into five parts. First, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Not a
                          Moment in Time</strong></span> chronicles the centuries-long history that stand behind policing and surveillance
                      of land in Los Angeles. Second, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Real Estate and Capitalist
                          Crisis</strong></span> uses storytelling and evidence to uncover the relationships between policing, capitalist
                      crisis, and real estate development. Third, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>LAPD&rsquo;s First
                          Generation of Predictive Policing (2009-2020 </strong></span>analyzes the specific programs, tactics, and tools
                      LAPD used to police the land and target individuals.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Fourth,</p>
                    <p>Fifth, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Predictive Policing 2.0</strong></span> analyzes how LAPD is
                      using notions of community policing and police accountability to &ldquo;reform&rdquo; data-driven policing. Finally,
                      the conclusion <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Abolition and Rebellion</strong></span> exposes the
                      limits of reformist responses to data-driven policing.</p>

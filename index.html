          <p>This report was envisioned, researched, and written by dozens of community members coming
            together to study the relationship of &ldquo;data-driven policing&rdquo; to real estate development, displacement, and
            gentrification.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The report comes from the Stop LAPD Spying Coalition&rsquo;s <strong>Land and Policing
              Workgroup</strong>. But it belongs to the community, produced through collective study and grassroots self-defense
            as named in our <a href="https://stoplapdspying.org/zine-grassroots-community-self-defense-statement-of-principles/"

          <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>TABLE OF CONTENTS</u></strong></p>
          <p>This report begins with an introduction that situates the analysis in our organizing campaigns and then continues in
            six parts:</p>
          <p><a href="#_5tpcaf9qu7v9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Part 1: Not a Moment in Time</strong></a> chronicles
            the centuries-long history that stands behind policing and surveillance of land in Los Angeles. The goal is to offer a
            historical overview of the history of policing, conquest, and displacement.</p>
          <p><a href="#_haigajat06wp" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Part 2: The</strong></a><a href="#_haigajat06wp"
              target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Architecture of Data-Driven Policing</strong></a> analyz es the programs,
            tactics, and tools that LAPD built its data-driven policing programs through, including their first-generation
            &ldquo;predictive&rdquo; policing programs as well as collaboration with other agencies. The goal is to introduce
            these programs, partnerships, and methodologies in order to later examine their use in displacement and gentrification
            as well as their evolution over time.</p>
          <p><a href="#_on82k9lxqgq" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Part 3: Real Estate and Capitalist Crisis</strong></a>
            uncovers links between policing, capitalist crisis, and real estate development. The goal is to share examples of
            these connections, which we uncovered in our organizing and research, in order to frame what inspired our deeper dive
            into these issues.</p>
          <p><a href="#_ythxofs2xnlc" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Part 4: Containment, Development, and the Fight for
                Freedom in Skid Row</strong></a> is the first of our two deep dives into data-driven policing&rsquo;s role in
            displacement, this one focusing on the history, present, and future of development and policing in Skid Row. The goal
            is to show how policing and surveillance have long been used to contain, blight, and banish Skid Row residents, with
            data technologies helping to automate this harm.</p>
          <p><a href="#_y7ucyyi2oel8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Part 5: Racial Terror and White Wealth in South
                Central</strong></a> is a deep dive into the role of LAPD&rsquo;s data-driven policing systems in gentrification
            and displacement of South Central L.A. The goal is to show how police terror and surveillance work in tandem with real
            estate development to banish Black and brown people and secure white wealth.</p>
          <p><a href="#_gbcskilo8yy3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Part 6: &ldquo;Reform&rdquo; of Data-Driven Policing
                and &ldquo;Predictive Policing 2.0&rdquo;</strong></a> examines LAPD&rsquo;s new Data-Informed Community-Focused
            Policing framework, launched in 2020. The goal is to analyze the reformist strategies that are being used to obscure,
            excuse, and broaden the violence of data-driven policing.</p>
          <p>Finally, the conclusion lists our demands and examines what it will take to abolish data-driven policing.</p>

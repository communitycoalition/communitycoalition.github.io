            <p>This report has reviewed the relationship of LAPD&rsquo;s
            data-driven policing programs to displacement, gentrification, and real estate development along with police reform,
            counterinsurgency, imperialism, and settler colonialism. Our demands regarding the violence of these programs are the
            same ones we&rsquo;ve long advanced: <a class="anchor" id="_ftn329" href="#_ftnref329">

            <ol>
            <li>Ban LAPD&rsquo;s use of data-driven policing tactics.</li>
            <li>Purge data collected through LAPD&rsquo;s &ldquo;broken windows,&rdquo; &ldquo;predictive,&rdquo; and data-driven
              policing tactics and programs.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Defund, divest, and disarm LAPD of all weapons of surveillance.</li>
            <li>Provide full disclosure on the use of data-driven policing tactics to all individuals, organizations, and
              locations targeted.</li>
            <li>Provide full reparations to individuals and neighborhoods harmed by surveillance and data-driven policing
              programs.</li>
            <li>Fund public hearings on the human impact of data-driven policing, hosted by a community-based body with no

          </ol><p>The abolitionist response to the policing of land has nothing to do with reforming these practices by
            &ldquo;cleaning up&rdquo; the data or creating new laws and policies for &ldquo;safer&rdquo; use. As abolitionists, we
            recognize the harms of policing are not just due to biases or discretion but due to the intent and purpose of
            policing, which has always been committed to protecting property, stealing land, enforcing exploitation, and caging,
            deporting, and murdering the people who the state wishes to banish.</p><p>Abolitionist analysis teaches us
            how police reform has always been integral to making the police state more durable and difficult to dismantle. Along
            those lines, reformist objections to data-driven policing either question the costs and effectiveness or warn about
            racism from &ldquo;dirty data&rdquo; or &ldquo;feedback loops&rdquo; that encode the biases of law enforcement. These
            criticisms object to the <em>execution</em> of predictive policing, treating racism as an unfortunate side effect of
            these programs rather than the foundational ideology and framework. Both proponents of data-driven policing and its
            mainstream opponents ignore the fundamental role and purpose of policing.</p><p>Our fight to abolish
            predictive policing must organize against the full ecology of actors who serve to strengthen policing. Abolition
            requires building a culture of resistance against that ecosystem, a culture of &ldquo;fuck the police.&rdquo; As the
            George Floyd rebellion laid bare, our people know what they want: police off their backs, an end to policing. Even
            when people don&rsquo;t say abolition, the vision is there. The resistance has always been there. You just need to be
            present for it.</p><p>No matter what we face &ndash; &ldquo;predictive&rdquo; policing yesterday,
            &ldquo;data-driven&rdquo; policing today, who knows what tomorrow &ndash; our power grows in the culture of resistance
            we build. Policing is part of a war launched centuries ago by slavers and colonizers trying to control our ancestors.
            For just as long, people have been fighting back. Join the fight!</p><div>

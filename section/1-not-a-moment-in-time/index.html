                  We begin with historical background. What lineage stands behind todayâ€™s policing?

              </figure>
              <p>From the start, the primary focus of U.S. settler colonialism has been to occupy land by controlling and policing it.
                Everyone and everything existing on that land must also be dominated, managed, or eliminated to make way for the white
                American settler project. For the U.S. state to sustain this violent process of land-taking and occupation, it had to
                defend the territory it stole as well as defend the ideology that perpetuates it. This is why we have police. It is
                impossible to separate police from land dominance because policing was created to uphold white supremacist conquest.
                Harm to people living on and in relationship with land is not an accidental result of policing: it is the intended
                result.</p>
              <p>In Los Angeles, land and policing have been interwoven since the beginning of European conquest. The Tongva people
                indigenous to this land have resisted centuries of successive Spanish, Mexican and U.S. rule which has included
                enslavement (downtown LA was converted into a <a

                  target="_blank" rel="noopener">landmarks</a>. Meanwhile, Los Angeles has been the recipient of waves of Indigenous
                peoples displaced by colonial violence, making it the home of the <a
                  href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=a9e370db955a45ba99c52fb31f31f1fc" target="_blank"
                  rel="noopener">&ldquo;largest Indigenous population of any city in the US.&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p>While the Tongva people struggle for land rights and resist their physical and cultural destruction, the settler
                colonial apparatus that forcibly severed them from their land has continued to target the Black and Indigenous peoples
                who have come to LA. The Tongva village where downtown Los Angeles now stands was forced to relocate, and the
                indigenous and Mexican people who came to the city in search of work were criminalized and incarcerated by police.
                This practice of segregating and caging non-white people is an intentional policy of the LA city government, to
                produce a society that is explicitly white and settler. Any discussion of the processes of neo-colonialism and
                continuation of conquest and land theft in the form of gentrification must be grounded in an understanding of Tongva
                history and ongoing resistance, and a commitment to Tongva sovereignty and land rights.</p>
              <p>While the manifestations of colonialism and conquest faced and resisted by the Gabrielino/Tongva nation have been
                diverse, we want to acknowledge that the particular relationship of this state to the indigenous communities is guided
                by the &ldquo;logic of elimination.&rdquo; This logic includes not only &ldquo;summary liquidation of Indigenous
                people&rdquo; but also the construction of a &ldquo;colonial society on the expropriated land base,&rdquo; thus
                turning invasion into a structure, which is then studiously guarded by police. In fact, the Tongva scholar Charles
                Sepulveda urges us to recognize the connectedness between the struggles for abolition and decolonization, considering
                them part of the same vision of &ldquo;creative re-imagining of human relationships to place, beyond the structures of
                white supremacy.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>As Los Angeles was being imagined as a haven for white settlers, so too was it imagined in Black communities as a
                place where they could find upward mobility through industrial work and land ownership in Southern California. As
                Black people fleeing the racial terror of Jim Crow came to LA for opportunity, the settler city responded with housing
                policies like redlining and racially restrictive covenants, barring Black communities from purchasing land outside of
                specifically designated areas, like the one along Central Avenue in South Central LA. White settlers along the
                perimeter of these areas feared that nearby Black neighborhoods threatened property values, and as a result, policing
                was concentrated along the Central Avenue corridor in order to violently constrict Black autonomy even in their own
                communities.</p>
              <p>By the 1970s, South Central LA not only faced systematic police violence but also deliberate deindustrialization and
                neoliberal economic policies, cratering the economy in Black communities that had relied primarily on factory
                industrial jobs. Mass unemployment led to increased displacement from housing, meaning that swelling numbers of Black
                people in Los Angeles were forced off land, then further marginalized by homelessness and increased violence by
                police. These dynamics extend into the present through the process of gentrification. As poor, working class,
                communities of color across Los Angeles were divested from and converted from an exploited labor pool to a
                &ldquo;surplus&rdquo; population, wealthy capitalist developers and the state alike have eyed their neighborhoods as
                places to generate white wealth.</p>
              <p><a href="https://crownschool.uchicago.edu/landscaping-neo-liberalism-weed-and-seed-strategy" target="_blank"
                  rel="noopener">1990s policies like Weed and Seed</a>, intended to &ldquo;weed out&rdquo; criminals and
                &ldquo;seed&rdquo; so-called &ldquo;neighborhood revitalization&rdquo; efforts, show how the police worked to advance
                the process of bringing white capital into spaces that in years prior had been violently segregated. The police act as
                the vanguard of this neo-colonial process, in which white wealth and white people invade communities that had been
                created in response to earlier colonialist and white supremacist policies like redlining, Jim Crow, and racialized
                incarceration. Adding to banishment and displacement led by local police, immigration police agencies like ICE
                viciously enforce the boundaries of not just neighborhoods but the state itself. The intended result of policing and
                gentrification like this is profound displacement and banishment of communities of color and working poor communities
                from the very places they found home in the face of previous waves of banishment and displacement.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>These policies deploying police as enforcers of neo-colonialism have been justified through &ldquo;public&rdquo;
                projects for sports or entertainment. For example, although the area was slated for public housing, the
                Mexican-American communities living in the area of La Loma, Bishop, and Palo Verde, renamed as Chavez Ravine, were
                evicted from a place that would become Dodgers Stadium. Police enforced the <a
                  href="https://laist.com/2018/10/17/dodger_stadium_chavez_ravine_battle.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">violent
                  Chavez Ravine eviction</a> in order to create a space for entertainment and consumer consumption. This pattern has
                continued in the history of Los Angeles: the 1984 Olympics justified a huge expansion and militarization of the LAPD
                even years before the Games, including military weaponry (like tanks) and counterinsurgency tactics. These cops were
                deployed in an enormous campaign of racial banishment in the form of gang sweeps in order to &ldquo;clean up&rdquo;
                the city for the Olympics, upholding a project that imagines LA as a playground for white wealth while razing the
                homes of Black, brown, and poor communities. Policies like this <a
                  href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/want-understand-1992-la-riots-start-1984-la-olympics/"
                  target="_blank" rel="noopener">directly led to the 1992 uprisings</a>. Those dynamics continue today, part of
                ongoing colonization and displacement. Sports projects in Inglewood like <a
                  href="https://theappeal.org/sofi-stadium-gentrification-displacement-lennox-inglewood-tenants-union/"
                  target="_blank" rel="noopener">SoFi Stadium</a>, created for the LA Olympics in 2028, receive tax breaks and
                subsidies from the city &ndash; at the same time as they violently displace Black, brown, and poor communities, and
                deploy the police to enforce that project of banishment.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The intent of these projects is never to provide for the community but to serve white conquest: creating an external
                facade to an extended campaign to stifle, silence, police, and criminalize those communities. The relationship between
                land and policing in Los Angeles is not just the physical presence of police, but also the structures built to
                maintain segregation and control even when police are not physically present. Together, the systems around
                surveillance and policing of land in Los Angeles extend and defend the power of the U.S. settler state.</p>

          <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>Not a Moment in Time</u></strong></p>
          <p style="text-align: center;"><em>We begin with history. What lineage stands behind today&rsquo;s policing?</em></p>
          <p>From the start, settlers in the U.S. have occupied land by policing it. Under settler colonialism, everyone and
            everything existing on that land must be dominated, managed, or eliminated to make way for the needs of white
            supremacy and capital. This is why we have police. It is impossible to separate policing from land theft and
            occupation. Harm to those in close relationship with land is not an accidental result of policing: it is the intended
            result.</p>
          <p>In Los Angeles, land and policing have been interwoven since the beginning of European conquest. The Tongva people
            indigenous to what we now call Los Angeles have resisted centuries of successive Spanish, Mexican and U.S. rule which
            has included enslavement (downtown LA was converted into a &ldquo;de facto slave market of Tongva labor&rdquo;)<a class="anchor"
              id="_ftn1" href="#_ftnref1" ><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a>, extermination, and forced
            assimilation.<a class ="anchor" id="_ftn2" href="#_ftnref2" ><sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup></a> Tongva people continue to
            struggle for official recognition and land rights, as well as for preservation of their landmarks. Meanwhile, Los
            Angeles has been the recipient of waves of Indigenous peoples displaced by colonial violence, making it the home of
            the &ldquo;largest Indigenous population of any city in the US.&rdquo;<a class ="anchor" id="_ftn3" href="#_ftnref3" ><sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup></a></p>
          <p>While the Tongva people struggle for land rights and resist their physical and cultural destruction, the settler
            colonial apparatus that forcibly severed them from their land has continued to target the Black and Indigenous peoples
            who have come to L.A. The Tongva village where downtown L.A. now stands was forced to relocate, and the Indigenous and
            Mexican people who came to the city in search of work were criminalized and incarcerated by police.<a class ="anchor" id="_ftn4" href="#_ftnref4" ><sup><sup>[4]</sup></sup></a> Any discussion of neocolonialism and the continuation
            of conquest and land theft must be grounded in an understanding of Tongva history and ongoing resistance, and a
            commitment to Tongva sovereignty and land rights.</p>
          <p>While the manifestations of colonialism and conquest faced and resisted by the Gabrielino and Tongva communities (as
            well as other indigenous people who have called this area home) have been diverse, what guides the state&rsquo;s
            relationship to these communities is the &ldquo;logic of elimination.&rdquo; This logic includes not only
            &ldquo;summary liquidation of Indigenous people&rdquo; but also the construction of a &ldquo;colonial society on the
            expropriated land base,&rdquo;<a class ="anchor" id="_ftn5" href="#_ftnref5" ><sup><sup>[5]</sup></sup></a> thus
            turning invasion into a political structure, which is then fiercely guarded by police. In fact, the Tongva scholar
            Charles Sepulveda urges us to recognize the connectedness between the struggles for police abolition and
            decolonization, considering them part of the same vision of &ldquo;creative re-imagining of human relationships to
            place, beyond the structures of white supremacy.&rdquo;<a class ="anchor" id="_ftn6" href="#_ftnref6" ><sup><sup>[6]</sup></sup></a></p>
          <p>The history of colonized Los Angeles also cannot be understood without a focus on the Black freedom struggle. At the
            same time Los Angeles was being imagined as a haven for white settlers, Black people also looked to the city as a
            place where they could seek upward mobility through industrial work and land ownership. As Black people fleeing the
            racial terror of Jim Crow came here for opportunity and survival, the settler city responded with housing policies
            like redlining and racially restrictive covenants, barring Black communities from owning land outside of specifically
            designated areas like the one along Central Avenue in South Central. White settlers along the perimeter of these areas
            feared that nearby Black neighborhoods would threaten property values. As a result, policing was concentrated along
            the Central Avenue corridor to violently constrict the autonomy of Black people even in their own communities.<a class="anchor" id="_ftn7" href="#_ftnref7" ><sup><sup>[7]</sup></sup></a></p>
          <p>By the 1970s, South Central not only faced systematic police violence but also deliberate deindustrialization and
            neoliberal economic policies. These policies cratered the economy in Black communities that had relied on factory
            industrial jobs. Mass unemployment led to increased displacement from housing, meaning that swelling numbers of Black
            people in Los Angeles were forced out of their homes and then further marginalized by increased police violence. These
            dynamics extend into the present through the process of gentrification. As divestment from poor and working class
            communities of color across Los Angeles transformed from an exploited labor pool to a &ldquo;surplus&rdquo;
            population, wealthy capitalist developers and the state alike eyed their neighborhoods as places to generate white
            wealth.<a class="anchor" id="_ftn8" href="#_ftnref8" ><sup><sup>[8]</sup></sup></a></p>
          <p>Policing was always central to those transformations. In the 1990s, policies like Weed and Seed sought to &ldquo;weed
            out&rdquo; unwanted segments of Black neighborhoods&nbsp; while handpicking others to &ldquo;seed&rdquo; for so-called
            &ldquo;revitalization&rdquo; efforts.<a class="anchor" id="_ftn9" href="#_ftnref9" ><sup><sup>[9]</sup></sup></a>
            These approaches show how police worked to advance the process of bringing white capital into spaces that in prior
            years had been violently segregated. Adding to banishment and displacement led by local police, immigration police
            agencies like ICE viciously enforce U.S. borders within our communities, policing the boundaries of the state itself.
          </p>
          <p>More than once in the history of Los Angeles, efforts to deploy police as enforcers of neo-colonialism have been
            justified through &ldquo;public&rdquo; projects for sports or entertainment. For example, the Mexican-American
            communities living in the areas of Palo Verde, La Loma, and Bishop were evicted from a place that would have been
            slated for public housing but instead became Dodgers Stadium. Police enforced the violent Chavez Ravine eviction in
            order to create a space for entertainment and consumer consumption.<a class="anchor" id="_ftn10" href="#_ftnref10" ><sup><sup>[10]</sup></sup></a></p>
          <p>This pattern of displacement to generate white wealth continued in the 1984 Olympics, which the city used to fund a
            huge expansion and militarization of the LAPD. Police executed a campaign of gang sweeps in order to &ldquo;clean
            up&rdquo; the city for the Olympics, upholding a project that imagines the city as a playground for white wealth while
            razing the homes of Black, brown, and poor communities. These dynamics directly led to the 1992 uprisings.<a
              class="anchor" id="_ftn11" href="#_ftnref11" ><sup><sup>[11]</sup></sup></a> They also continue today, with sports
            projects like SoFi Stadium in Inglewood created for the 2028 Olympics receiving tax breaks and subsidies from the
            city, while at the same time displacing Black, brown, and poor communities.<a class="anchor" id="_ftn12" href="#_ftnref12" ><sup><sup>[12]</sup></sup></a></p>
          <p>The relationship between land and policing in Los Angeles goes beyond the physical presence of police. As the rest of
            this report shows, that relationship also includes the structures built to maintain segregation and control even when
            police are not physically present. Whether or not a police officer is physically present, the conquest that policing
            represents is always there. Together, the systems that comprise surveillance and policing of land in Los Angeles
            extend and defend the power of the U.S. settler state.</p>

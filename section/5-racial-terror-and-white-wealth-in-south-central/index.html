          </p><p>
            <em>This section is a deep dive into data-driven policing&rsquo;s deployment of South Central. This report first
              looked at South Central in part 3, connecting the role of capitalist crisis and real estate development to policing
              in these communities. Here we look closer at the impacts and operational details of that policing.</em>
          </p><p>South of downtown and Skid Row, the historically Black neighborhoods of South Central have long been
            targets of police abuse. This is another place that LAPD has always honed new forms of racial violence, surveillance,
            and brutality. Operation LASER first launched in 2011 at LAPD&rsquo;s Newton Division, headquartered on South Central
            Avenue, before spreading to four additional divisions including Southwest Division by December 2013. <a class="anchor"
              id="_ftn193" href="#_ftnref193">
              <sup>
                <sup>[193]</sup>
              </sup>
            </a></p><p>LASER helped automate the forms of violent policing that have always been used to
            terrorize residents of South Central, including &ldquo;broken windows&rdquo; policing, &ldquo;proactive&rdquo; and
            pretextual targeting of Black pedestrians and drivers, stop-and-frisk, militarized raids, and gang injunctions.
            Data-driven policing builds on this violent policing as well linking it to the displacement, banishment, and
            gentrification of the community&rsquo;s Black residents. Racialized policing of South Central cannot be separated from
            the gentrification the community is experiencing today, pushing out the traditionally working class Black and brown
            communities to make room for real estate speculation, corporate mega-projects, and predominantly white displacers.</p>
          <p>This section examines data-driven policing&rsquo;s role in both banishing Black residents of South Central
            while empowering white capitalists, developers, and gentrifiers who are seeking to transform the area for profit. The
            first half of this section, titled <strong>
              <u>Operation LASER&rsquo;s Racial Terror</u>, </strong>shares what we&rsquo;ve uncovered about the impact of
            LAPD&rsquo;s &ldquo;predictive policing&rdquo; programs in the Crenshaw Corridor. The second half, <strong>
              <u>Black Self-Determination, White Wealth, and Data-Driven Policing</u>
            </strong>, explores police-developer collaboration in those same areas.</p><p

            Chesterfield Square, Gramercy Park, Hyde Park, South Park at 51st and Menlo, Vermont Knolls, Vermont Park, and View
            Heights) in March 2015 with six LASER zones, whose general role we introduced above in part 2 of this report. <a

            77th Division designated Anchor Points. <a class="anchor" id="_ftn195" href="#_ftnref195">

              href="#_ftnref196">
              <sup>
                <sup>[196]</sup>

                <sup>[197]</sup>

            </a> starting in 2015. In addition, local high schools are also outlined on Southwest Division maps, suggesting a
            strategy of monitoring and criminalizing young people through these programs as well.</p><p>
            LASER&rsquo;s demographic targeting was hardly accidental. LASER&rsquo;s architects specifically studied the
            community&rsquo;s demographic and racial characteristics and then used crime data to assign criminality to those
            characteristics. An internal report dated June 2016 from Justice and Security Strategies (JSS), the consulting firm
            that built Operation LASER, matched the locations of incidents that LAPD recorded as violent or gun-related and then
            used census data to link race, age, and additional characteristics to these locations. <a class="anchor" id="_ftn198"
              href="#_ftnref198">
              <sup>
                <sup>[198]</sup>
              </sup>
            </a> JSS thereby concluded that this crime was more likely to be &ldquo;located in areas where there is a higher
            percentage of African-American residents,&rdquo; and &ldquo;more likely to be located in areas with lower
            owner-occupied housing and higher female-head of households.&rdquo; Many of the areas deemed &ldquo;high crime&rdquo;
            in this analysis coincided with what would later be labelled Anchor Points or LASER zones, turning everyone in these
            areas into a potential suspect.</p><p>LAPD&rsquo;s LASER zones and Anchor Points for the Crenshaw
            corridor are shown on the map below, along with the names of people who LAPD shot or killed inside those LASER zones.
            Also outlined is the location of LAPD&rsquo;s Community Safety Partnership (CSP, described in more detail in part 6 of
            this report) site at Harvard Park, established in 2017. The residential housing area facing takeover by corporate
            landlords discussed in section 3 of this report is indicated with a teal dashed line.</p>

            in an alley on the way to school. He had been rapping and dancing with his friends, which they later explained was

            more broadly the larger rationalization of "location-based" policing through data-driven surveillance. As we examined
            the details of LASER, we began to recognize how these shootings and killings were some of the most tragic excesses of
            a broad and relentless campaign of data-driven racial terror.</p>

            <p>Operation LASER was implemented
            differently in each LAPD division but the overall purpose was the same: declaring specific areas
            &ldquo;high-crime&rdquo; and saturating them with police to contain, surveil, criminalize, harass, extract, and banish
            people. Police deployed in these areas were also armed with Palantir-generated &ldquo;mission&rdquo; sheets offering
            vague profiles of potential &ldquo;criminal&rdquo; suspects, along with Palantir Mobile notifications that put
            so-called &ldquo;Chronic Offenders&rdquo; notices and other data at police fingertips. <a class="anchor" id="_ftn204"

            </a> This technology galvanized officers, who felt primed by &ldquo;data&rdquo; and &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; to
            violently target specific people, profiles, and zones. <a class="anchor" id="_ftn205" href="#_ftnref205">

            </a> Internal LAPD announcements and information about also revealed a zeal for dehumanizing the people and
            neighborhoods being targeted. For example, the first slide of Mission Division&rsquo;s internal PowerPoint
            presentation about LASER in March 2017 (shown right) appears to show a laser burning through local
            neighborhoods.</p><p>Along the Crenshaw Corridor, LAPD tactics in LASER zones and Anchor Points
            could be grouped into four categories: &ldquo;Crime Suppression,&rdquo; Surveillance, Infiltration and Community
            Policing, and Person-Based Policing:</p><p>
            <u>Crime Suppression</u> - The &ldquo;crime suppression&rdquo; tactics used by LAPD during Operation LASER included
            increased &ldquo;high-visibility&rdquo; patrols and footbeats and even LAPD decoy cars, sometimes parked at local
            businesses, to boost the impression of police presence. Multiple units were assigned to patrol LASER zones and Anchor
            Points with the overarching purpose of &ldquo;crime suppression.&rdquo; The time spent by cops in each area was
            referred to as &ldquo;dosage,&rdquo; and units logged their citations, arrests, field interviews, traffic warnings,
            pedestrian and traffic stops, guns taken, and hours spent in the area as weekly &ldquo;results.&rdquo; The broader
            violence of LAPD&rsquo;s data-driven &ldquo;crime suppression&rdquo; missions is examined in closer detail later in
            this section.
          </p><p>
            <u>Surveillance</u> - Over the years LAPD has tested and expanded its surveillance infrastructure in South Central,
            including with the help of business partners like Target Corporation, which purchased Palantir for LAPD in 2007, <a

            relentless police stops, questioning, brutality, and arrests. These missions were plotted through Palantir&rsquo;s
            &ldquo;Mission Control&rdquo; interface from the Community Safety Operation Center (CSOC) spy garrisons we introduced
            in part 2. Legions of police were dispatched to these locations and given profiles of who to stop (sometimes as vague
            as a &ldquo;Black male&rdquo; robbery suspect, as noted below), tasked with &ldquo;transient suppression&rdquo; or
            &ldquo;gang suppression,&rdquo; or just directed to the area to harass whoever they wanted. At the same time these
            missions were data driven, they also generated mass data on the community, gathering people&rsquo;s personal
            information, mapping networks and relationships, and tracking locations and movements. Back at the CSOC, the missions
            were evaluated based on how many stops, arrests, and FI cards officers generated.</p><p>LAPD units terrorized
            the communities during these data-driven &ldquo;missions.&rdquo;&nbsp; One mission sheet from Metro Division for the
            Crenshaw Mall area in 2017 resulted in 110 stops over 4 days. <a class="anchor" id="_ftn221" href="#_ftnref221">

            </a> And while Black people are far more likely to be stopped, stops of white people were more likely to find
            contraband. LAPD also uses stops to collect and mine data on Black people at far higher rates, filling out FI cards
            during 16% of stops of Black people and only 5% for stops of white people. These practices have since been exposed as
            being fueled by a &ldquo;de facto quota system&rdquo; that involved the falsification of information about people
            stopped in order to meet expected goals regarding stops, arrests, and citations. <a class="anchor" id="_ftn231"

            specific locations but also the profiles that police data analysts group as crime &ldquo;trends&rdquo; and hand to
            patrol officers. LAPD records from Southwest Division show police looking for crime &ldquo;clusters&rdquo; on the map,
            then noting &ldquo;trends&rdquo; in this data that are as vague as &ldquo;Male Black 15-30yoa,&rdquo; &ldquo;male

            males:</p><p>By providing only vague descriptions, these mission sheets ensured any Black person
            could be stopped for &ldquo;meeting the description.&rdquo; In addition, Black youth were further subject to policing
            in and around schools, a number of which are also located in the area of Crenshaw Corridor. From 2011 to 2013, youth
            attending high schools and middle schools along the Crenshaw Corridor, including Audubon Middle School and Crenshaw

          </p><p>With that backdrop of the function and toll of data-driven policing of South Central LA, we now turn to
            the role of real estate development. As noted in part 3 of this report, the financial crisis and Great Recession of
            2008 led to a foreclosure crisis in South Central. Corporate landlords and wealthy investors from outside LA&rsquo;s
            historically Black and brown neighborhoods exploited this capitalist crisis to expand their hold on the community.</p>
          <p>That encroachment and real estate speculation grew with the Opportunity Zone Program created in the Tax Cuts
            and Jobs Act of 2017, which created major tax breaks for banks investing in historically underdeveloped communities.
            Yet when Nipsey Hussle and other Black residents tried to orient those same investment opportunities to prevent
            displacement, secure Black wealth, and protect the community, they were targeted and harassed by police.</p>
          <p>Today that comparison between assertions of Black self-determination and white investors looking to displace the
            community is especially resonant in the fight for Black-led community ownership of the Crenshaw Mall. A longtime
            gathering place and community hub for South Central&rsquo;s Black residents, the mall has also long been a target of
            data-driving policing. LAPD built a substation inside the mall after the 1992 uprising, <a class="anchor" id="_ftn236"

            <p>As outside investors looked to move in flanked by police, community members continued to maintain
            a fierce culture of resistance. Residents like artist and entrepreneur Nipsey Hussle, who grew up in the Crenshaw
            District expressed a vision for the area in a way that was inclusive of existing communities and considerate of what
            neighbors needed. <a class="anchor" id="_ftn241" href="#_ftnref241">

            </a> In 2017, Nipsey purchased the Marathon Clothing Store at 3420 West Slauson Plaza. About the store&rsquo;s
            location, Nipsey explained: &ldquo;It was an important intersection, there was a lot of commerce going on. It made
            sense. We wanted to have our own space, and tell our own story.&rdquo; <a class="anchor" id="_ftn242"

            </a> Key to that self-determination was owning the land: &ldquo;This was always one of our dreams - in this parking
            lot we were always outside hustling in the actual lot, and we realized it made sense to be owners, or for us to have
            businesses in this parking lot.&rdquo; <a class="anchor" id="_ftn243" href="#_ftnref243">

            </a></p><p>Two years later, Nipsey partnered with longtime collaborator David Gross to purchase the
            entire strip mall where Marathon was located, with plans to build a six-story mixed-use plaza that included low-income
            residential units. <a class="anchor" id="_ftn244" href="#_ftnref244">

                <sup>[244]</sup>
              </sup>
            </a> The project was part of a plan to accumulate more properties and link them to a newly created investment fund
            called Our Opportunity that would take advantage of the new Opportunity Zone program enacted in the Tax Cuts and Jobs
            Act of 2017. This law created generous tax breaks for profits generated in certain economically distressed
            neighborhoods. By 2019, the Treasury Department had designated 8,700 zones nationwide as Opportunity Zones.
          </p><p>While the Trump administration and others promoted Opportunity Zones as a vehicle for capital
            investments in Black neighborhoods, Nipsey recognized that the program would enable displacement and extraction by
            outside investors. <a class="anchor" id="_ftn245" href="#_ftnref245">
              <sup>
                <sup>[245]</sup>
              </sup>
            </a> The idea behind the Our Opportunity fund was to allow smaller local investors to purchase homes in the community
            while receiving a tax break that otherwise would likely have gone to wealthy outside opportunists. Yet while Nipsey
            planned out and invested in ways to benefit the Crenshaw community he grew up in, LAPD continued its surveillance of
            residents. This is how Nipsey explained it in a 2013 interview:</p><p>

            police stopping people and collecting their data using FI cards because, even if the information &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t

            exploitation. As noted in part 3 above, the 2008 housing and foreclosure crisis enabled large corporate investors to
            sweep up properties previously owned by South Central residents. More recently, developers, banks, and speculators
            have been further drawn in by the Opportunity Zones introduced in 2017. Many of these investors have close connections

            </strong>
          </p><p>Within days of the Opportunity Zone announcement by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who began his
            career at Goldman Sachs, the investment firm moved fast to pursue these tax breaks. In August 2018, Bloomberg reported
            that Goldman Sachs had quickly determined that &ldquo;more than $5 billion&rdquo; of &ldquo;the roughly $7 billion the
            firm has deployed since its inception . . . went to projects in areas eligible to become opportunity zones&rdquo; and
            thus potentially eligible for massive tax breaks.&rdquo; <a class="anchor" id="_ftn274" href="#_ftnref274">

                <sup>[274]</sup>
              </sup>
            </a> The same article noted that the Opportunity Zones law contains no protections to ensure that investors
            don&rsquo;t replace affordable units with higher-priced rentals. In lieu of those protections, Goldman Sachs claimed
            it would &ldquo;voluntarily measure the outcomes of its projects&rdquo; to &ldquo;align their goals with community
            priorities.&rdquo; So not only would the mega-bank exercise massive power to gentrify neighborhoods, it would also
            assume the role of measuring and translating the community&rsquo;s priorities.</p><p>Goldman Sachs
            is also deeply connected to the Los Angeles Police Foundation (LAPF), where Mnuchin served on the Board of Directors
            before joining the Trump administration. <a class="anchor" id="_ftn275" href="#_ftnref275">

              </sup>
            </a> LAPF is a nonprofit organization established to provide LAPD resources without the scrutiny that direct funding
            and donations face. In 2019, Goldman Sachs anonymously donated $250,000 through LAPF to fund the Community Safety
            Partnerships (CSP) program in Harvard Park. (While the donation was presented to LAPD as an anonymous gift, tax
            documents as well as audit records from LAPD&rsquo;s Office of Inspector General confirm that this money came from
            Goldman Sachs. <a class="anchor" id="_ftn276" href="#_ftnref276">

                <sup>[276]</sup>
              </sup>
            </a>)</p><p>Harvard Park is also in an Opportunity Zone, and one nearby intersection (Slauson and
            Western) has been an Anchor Point since 2015. CSP sites also have been testing grounds for LAPD surveillance, for
            example with wireless cameras streaming live video to local cop cars at the Jordan Downs public housing complex. <a
              class="anchor" id="_ftn277" href="#_ftnref277">

                <sup>[277]</sup>
              </sup>
            </a> These cameras sites tell officers where youth may be gathering, and in the case of Richard Risher, an 18-year-old
            Black youth killed by GED officers in the Nickerson Gardens CSP (also a LASER Zone), the cameras filmed
            Richard&rsquo;s murder by police. <a class="anchor" id="_ftn278" href="#_ftnref278">
              <sup>
                <sup>[278]</sup>
              </sup>
            </a></p><p>The relationship between all these actors and police is something we must continue to
            research and organize against. What is starkly clear is that while Black residents of South Central were forced to
            navigate threats of police violence and banishment, real estate developers collaborated with LAPD on displacement,
            even donating salaries, weapons, surveillance equipment, and real estate for police officers deployed in the
            communities. In part 6, we analyze how these developers have subsidized &ldquo;community policing&rdquo;
            programs that are integral to policing&rsquo;s role in gentrification as well as funded &ldquo;research&rdquo;
            sanitizing this harm. Now integrated into data-driven policing, &ldquo;community policing&rdquo; and police reform are
            part of how the city secures white wealth while expanding Black subordination and even death.&nbsp;</p>

                then Deputy Chief Dennis Kato stated, &ldquo;&lsquo;Officer morale skyrocketed. Those motor cops now felt that
                instead of just writing tickets for traffic violations, they were actually doing something to combat crime by
                looking for these vehicles.&rsquo;&rdquo; See Nancy Perry, &ldquo; <a

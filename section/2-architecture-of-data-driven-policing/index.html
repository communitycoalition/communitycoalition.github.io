              <u class="report-section-title">The Architecture of Data-Driven Policing</u>
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>This part introduces the LAPD architecture, weaponry, and experiments that data-driven policing is built on. By
            &ldquo;architecture&rdquo; we mean not just technologies but also police strategies and legal instruments.
            Data-driven policing enables unprecedented coordination of these weapons.</p>
          <p>Our story here begins with Bill Bratton, LAPD&rsquo;s chief from 2002 and 2009. Under Bratton&rsquo;s leadership
            LAPD built up a number of practices that are now woven together as data-driven policing, including &ldquo;broken
            windows&rdquo; policing; &ldquo;intelligence-led&rdquo; policing; collection and mining of mass data; and
            behavioral surveillance. After examining those practices, this section turns to LAPD&rsquo;s testing of
            surveillance technologies that came to form the inputs of data-driven policing, as well as the Palantir data
            platform and the build-up of &ldquo;fusion centers&rdquo; that exchange police intelligence and coordinate mass
            surveillance. Next we examine LAPD&rsquo;s Operation LASER and PredPol &ldquo;predictive policing&rdquo; programs;
            LAPD&rsquo;s notion of &ldquo;Designing Out Crime&rdquo;; and the Citywide Nuisance Abatement Program (CNAP),
            which was used to target properties and displace people within Operation LASER.</p>

            <blockquote>
              “The department is not organized to fight crime. It's organized to circle the
              wagons. I'm trying to have it move towards being a proactive, risk-taking organization.”

          </figure>

          <p>In the late 1990s through the post-9/11 era, LAPD began adopting tactics and technology centering around
            &ldquo;intelligence-led policing,&rdquo; a model of speculative and hunch-based policing that encompasses behavioral
            surveillance and police data-mining. These changes accelerated with the appointment of Bill Bratton in 2002 as LAPD
            chief. Bratton looked to intelligence-led policing as one of the &ldquo;reforms&rdquo; he would use to claim that
            police violence was scientific and based on data.</p>
          <p>As many of us remember, the 1990s featured both extreme police brutality and a presidential administration that
            accelerated mass incarceration through the infamous 1994 Crime Bill, written by then Senator Joe Biden. As L.A.
            watched LAPD&rsquo;s violent beating of Rodney King and the Christopher Commission attempted to lay a path for
            &ldquo;reform,&rdquo; LAPD became engulfed in the Rampart Scandal, exposing further police brutality and corruption.
            This and other LAPD scandals culminated in a 2001 consent decree with the U.S. Department of Justice, placing LAPD
            under federal oversight due to patterns of false arrests, extreme violence, and other illegalities. <a class="anchor"
              id="_ftn13" href="#_ftnref13">
              <sup>
                <sup>[13]</sup>
              </sup>
            </a>
          </p>
          <p>Bill Bratton was appointed police chief following those scandals. Before taking that job, Bratton was a
            &ldquo;leading member&rdquo; of the consulting team hired under a five-year, $11 million contract with the city to
            implement the consent decree reforms. <a class="anchor" id="_ftn14" href="#_ftnref14">
              <sup>
                <sup>[14]</sup>
              </sup>
            </a> After just five months on that team, Bratton applied for the job of LAPD chief. Though police reformers declared
            the consent decree a victory and turning point for an embattled police department, ultimately this moment served as
            another LAPD power grab for new police resources and powers. Using the consent decree as a justification for new
            investments, Bratton pursued a series of experiments that expanded LAPD&rsquo;s data-collection and surveillance
            powers, including community policing, &ldquo;broken window&rdquo; policing, behavioral surveillance programs, and
            integration of military surveillance technologies. Skid Row in particular became a testing ground for how
            counterterrorism and counterinsurgency programs would become integrated into everyday policing. </p>
          <p>Two significant changes came to LAPD before &ldquo;predictive policing&rdquo; launched, both forming the foundation
            for LAPD&rsquo;s data-driven policing programs: &ldquo;broken windows&rdquo; policing and Compstat. The term
            &ldquo;broken windows&rdquo; was popularized by a 1982 article published by George Kelling and James Q. Wilson. <a
              class="anchor" id="_ftn15" href="#_ftnref15">
              <sup>
                <sup>[15]</sup>
              </sup>
            </a> The basic idea is that draconian criminalization of trivially harmful behaviors like public intoxication,
            littering, and jaywalking &ldquo;prevents&rdquo; larger crimes. This practice was nothing new to Skid Row, as
            discussed in detail in part 5 of this report. But turning this policing into a criminological theory popularized the
            idea that poverty should be dealt with by criminalizing individual &ldquo;behavior,&rdquo; ignoring the systemic
            failings of white supremacist capitalist society. Bratton made this view explicit in a 2007 interview: </p>
          <p>&ldquo;The one thing I have learned&mdash;and now strongly advocate&mdash;is that the police, properly resourced and
            directed, can control behavior to such a degree that we can change behavior. Many social scientists are wedded to what
            I believe to be the failed and never proven idea that crime is caused by the structural features of a capitalist-based
            democratic society&mdash;especially demographics, economic imbalance, racism, and poverty.&rdquo; <a class="anchor"
              id="_ftn16" href="#_ftnref16">
              <sup>
                <sup>[16]</sup>
              </sup>
            </a>
          </p>
          <p>Bratton also led the effort to build Compstat, a program he first popularized as chief of NYPD in the 1990s. Compstat
            is a data system that generates regular summaries of what a police department is doing. These summaries are reviewed
            at meetings where police leadership determine policing strategies and priorities. Compstat helped organize
            &ldquo;broken windows&rdquo; policing. George Kelling, who popularized &ldquo;broken windows&rdquo; policing, once
            called Compstat &ldquo;the most important administrative policing development of the past 100 years.&rdquo; <a
              class="anchor" id="_ftn17" href="#_ftnref17">
              <sup>
                <sup>[17]</sup>
              </sup>
            </a>
          </p>
          <p>Compstat also furthered the collection and legitimization of crime data, treating it as scientific fact rather than a
            reflection of racist and subjective enforcement choices of police. Bratton&rsquo;s confederation of Compstat and
            &ldquo;broken windows&rdquo; policing also laid the groundwork for expansion of behavioral surveillance, which refers
            to police practices of speculatively monitoring behaviors that may be indicative of future crime. This kind of
            intelligence-gathering, according to Bratton, is &ldquo;what police have always done, to observe and identify changing
            patterns of behavior.&rdquo; <a class="anchor" id="_ftn18" href="#_ftnref18">
              <sup>

              </sup>
            </a>
          </p>
          <p>Bratton was not only successful in promoting police brutality as public policy, he also wedded police data to the
            notion of &ldquo;community policing.&rdquo; The objective here was to strengthen cooperation, communication, and
            partnership between police, city officials, and private &ldquo;stakeholders&rdquo; like real estate developers and
            businesses. In fact, the U.S. Department of Justice&rsquo;s Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) office used
            data collected in part from LAPD while Bratton was chief to promote the "co-implementation" of Compstat and community
            policing, calling them both "powerful engines of police reform." <a class="anchor" id="_ftn19" href="#_ftnref19">

          </p>
          <p>LAPD has long been one of the most technologically resourced police forces in the country, with a yearly budget of
            over $3.2 billion that consumes half the city&rsquo;s discretionary spending. Over the years, LAPD&rsquo;s expansion
            of its architecture of surveillance has taken the form both of new digital technologies and mass surveillance
            equipment as well as campaigns of racial profiling, pretextual street and vehicle stops, and &ldquo;broken
            windows&rdquo; policing that generate mass troves of police data for LAPD&rsquo;s Record Management System and other
            databases. These surveillance inputs fuel data-driven policing. For more of our research into LAPD&rsquo;s

          <p>In part 5 of this report, we explore in greater detail how Skid Row is a place where LAPD has long experimented with
            new forms of policing. This too is characteristic of colonization. As we&rsquo;ve written elsewhere, LAPD&rsquo;s
            testing, refinement, and &ldquo;reform&rdquo; of surveillance technologies &ldquo;continues the legacy of colonial
            experimentation in service of white supremacist political ends &mdash; much in the same way colonial administrators
            used legal bureaucracy, surveillance technology, and even scientific study to dominate people they considered
            seditious or politically threatening.&rdquo; <a class="anchor" id="_ftn20" href="#_ftnref20">

          <p>Skid Row along with MacArthur Park are some of the places where LAPD first tests new surveillance technologies. For
            example, in November 2007, LAPD implemented a <strong>

            Initiative (SCI) &ldquo;broken windows&rdquo; policing program. These officers were chosen because their policing
            includes foot beats and constant enforcement contacts with people in the community. <a class="anchor" id="_ftn26"

            phone towers to connect and monitor mobile devices. In 2011, the Los Angeles Police Foundation gave almost $25,000 to

          <p>Of course, technology isn&rsquo;t the only way LAPD gathers mass surveillance data. Some of the most critical and

              <u>Field Interview (FI) cards</u>
            </strong> that generate data for LAPD&rsquo;s records systems. A person does not have to be suspected of any crime to
            have an FI card filled out. A large number of these cards are filled out by LAPD&rsquo;s proactive policing Metro
            units as well as the HOPE (Homeless Outreach Proactive Engagement) and RESET (Resources Enhancement Services
            Enforcement Team) units that target unhoused communities. In the first half of 2018, HOPE and RESET completed over

            status (including disabilities, pregnancy status, HIV status, mental health), education, employment, and whether they
            have experienced domestic violence. Anyone using the services is placed into the database, no matter the length of

            like HUD, HHS, and the VA without personal identifiers, and the risk of these databases being accessed by local law
            enforcement and DHS including ICE is very high. In 2017, LAPD told the <a

            consulting firm headed by Craig Uchida. At LAPD, Deputy Chief Sean Malinowski was the lead investigator for the SPI
            research grant. LAPD and JSS worked together to develop LASER, which targeted both specific locations (which police
            deemed &ldquo;LASER zones&rdquo; or &ldquo;Anchor Points&rdquo;) and specific community members (who police deemed
            &ldquo;chronic offenders&rdquo;).&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

            LASER. The records we obtained confirmed what the community had suspected: while promoted as a scientific
            "breakthrough,&rdquo; LASER was yet another campaign of racial profiling and territorial enforcement.</p>
          <p>To select LASER zones, LAPD and JSS analysts combined hot spot mapping of crime reports with recommendations from
            local officers. Within each zone police also identified Anchor Points, which were locations considered &ldquo;possibly

            </a> While this designation was potentially devastating, there was no standard process or criteria for selecting the
            locations, which included businesses, residences, and community gathering places. JSS even noted that &ldquo;public
            transportation centers, shopping centers, fast food restaurants, and other types of establishments . . . can be

          <p>As these murders harm a community, LAPD and its collaborators characterize this violence as necessary simply because
            an algorithm labeled our people&rsquo;s communities, streets, stores, or homes a place where crime &ldquo;will&rdquo;
            happen.</p>

            <u>LASER&rsquo;s &ldquo;Chronic Offender&rdquo; Bulletins</u>
          </p>
          <p>In addition to the location-based aspects noted above, LAPD&rsquo;s data-driven programs also include person-based
            targeting. True to the term &ldquo;Extraction&rdquo; in the LASER acronym, the program used data-mining to target
            individuals for banishment. LAPD generated hit lists called &ldquo;Chronic Offender&rdquo; bulletins, which police
            appeared to use as targets whenever there was an open case or suspicion. Police subjected these individuals to
            criminalization, coercive prosecution, and enforcement of parole and probation conditions to remove them from their
            communities, including the neighborhoods where people had grown up or had always lived with their families.</p>
          <p>The way LASER&rsquo;s individualized targeting was purported to work was that LAPD&rsquo;s Crime Intelligence Details
            (CIDs, division units comprised of three sworn officers and a crime analyst) used Palantir technology to harvest data
            collected through FI cards, arrest records, the CalGang database, and &ldquo;crime&rdquo; history to give individuals
            risk scores. The scores generated through Palantir were used to assemble Chronic Offender bulletins, essentially
            &ldquo;most wanted&rdquo; fliers showing a person&rsquo;s picture and personal information that were shared across
            LAPD divisions and units as people the police should target and harass proactively. Even though LAPD claimed to use a
            point system to standardize this process, a 2019 audit by the Office of the Inspector General uncovered that 112 of
            637 people who were in the &ldquo;Chronic Offender&rdquo; database at the time had zero points under the LAPD
            criteria. <a class="anchor" id="_ftn61" href="#_ftnref61">
              <sup>
                <sup>[61]</sup>
              </sup>
            </a>
          </p>
          <p>Once people were marked as Chronic Offenders, special units were to go knock on their doors and tell whoever was
            there that police are watching them. <a class="anchor" id="_ftn62" href="#_ftnref62">
              <sup>
                <sup>[62]</sup>
              </sup>
            </a> These units also served warrants, conducted parole and probation checks (even though they were not probation and
            parole officers), and pulled over or stopped people whenever they would see them. In 2019, a lawsuit we filed forced
            the release of lists of the people who LAPD targeted. Our analysis of these lists revealed that nearly half the people
            targeted are Black (even though Black people are 9% of the city&rsquo;s population), some were as young as 16, and
            many are unhoused. </p>
          <p>We recently began reaching out to the individuals on these lists and speaking to them. None knew they were being
            targeted, but they all lived lives of daily police abuse. After we explained what LASER was, the first thing nearly
            all of them told us was some version of &ldquo;it all makes sense now.&rdquo; Police constantly harassed them and
            broke into their homes, terrorizing their families and arresting them over nothing. &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t I feel safe
            in my house?&rdquo; one person said, &ldquo;I just feel helpless. I can&rsquo;t even walk to the bus stop without
            being pulled over.&rdquo; Another person on the lists told us officers breaking into his home warned him that they
            &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t rest until they sent me away for good.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
          <p>LASER was intended to make life intolerable for people in their own communities to the point where they would either
            abandon their neighborhoods or end up in prison. In this way, these programs apply the &ldquo;attrition through
            enforcement&rdquo; and &ldquo;self-deportation&rdquo; approaches that have long been the basis of federal treatment of
            Indigenous people as well as how state and local governments treat migrants. <a class="anchor" id="_ftn63"

                <sup>[64]</sup>
              </sup>
            </a> More broadly, these tactics were the latest form of speculative criminalization of entire communities, in the
            lineage of gang injunctions, gang databases, and stop-and-frisk &ndash;&nbsp;all of which have been instrumental to
            dispossession, banishment, and racial segregation. Many of the people we reached out to from the lists are now
            incarcerated in state prisons far from home, leaving behind families who have told us the stories of how their loved
            ones were targeted. </p>
          <p>We are continuing to research LASER&rsquo;s personal toll, meeting with and learning from people whose names were in
            the Chronic Offender database when the program was suspended in summer 2018 before it was completely ended in 2019. We
            have heard nothing from the majority of the people on the Chronic Offender lists. LASER&rsquo;s experimentation with
            &ldquo;removing&rdquo; people no doubt ended in death for some.</p>

          <p>PredPol&rsquo;s guesses about future crimes were driven by three elements of historical crime data: crime type, crime
            location, and a crime timestamp. This reported crime data originated from crime reports filed by police along with
            calls for service, both of which can be entirely unsubstantiated allegations. LAPD provided PredPol &ldquo;an
            automated data dump that happened every 2 hours,&rdquo; also characterized by LAPD as &ldquo;a &lsquo;direct injection
            information transfer,&rsquo; meaning the automated data stream was compiled and sent directly to the PredPol website
            for consumption.&rdquo; <a class="anchor" id="_ftn73" href="#_ftnref73">

                <sup>[73]</sup>
              </sup>
            </a> PredPol used this data to make algorithmic predictions about which 500 x 500 square foot areas, called &ldquo;hot
            spots,&rdquo; had the highest expected crime rate within the city. These reports were distributed to officers to guide
            their patrols. </p>
          <p>The mainstream critique of PredPol has been centered on the feedback loop that results from collecting biased and
            &ldquo;bad&rdquo; data, automating the same results. As this theory goes, when police target an area it generates more
            crime reports, arrests, and stops at that location and the subsequent crime data will lead the algorithm to direct
            police back to the same area. While this feedback effect from policing&rsquo;s own activity perpetuating itself has
            been proven (and should be no surprise), other logics also appeared when we began to map PredPol hot spots, LASER
            zones, and Anchor Points. We discuss these findings in part 4 of this report, situating them in the broader history of
            how Skid Row has been policed.</p>

            install or remove physical and natural structures in order to facilitate policing and surveillance. According to an
            LAPD press release from 2001, &ldquo;Design Out Crime makes &lsquo;community policing&rsquo; more than a mere

            be able to patrol by here and look into this mall area and be able to see a greater area in a shorter amount of time,
            which translates into me going down the street and patrolling another area. If I have to stop, get out of the vehicle,
            get out of my vehicle and walk over to this area because it&rsquo;s concealed by walls and shrubbery and

          <p>After LAPD&rsquo;s Data-Informed Community-Focused Policing framework launched in April 2020, we filed a PRA request
            seeking any CPTED assessments produced under the program. In response, LAPD disclosed nine assessments conducted in
            late 2020 for Community Safety Partnership (CSP) &ldquo;community policing&rdquo; sites, which are discussed in
            greater detail in part 6 of this report. On first glance, large portions of these assessments hardly seem tailored to
            &ldquo;specific neighborhoods,&rdquo; instead repeating boilerplate recommendations about the need to install more
            surveillance. <a class="anchor" id="_ftn82" href="#_ftnref82">

              </sup>
            </a> Even where the assessments note that some of the infrastructural changes were requested by local residents, we
            have learned that these same proposals had been made years earlier by residents who were told by city officials that
            the changes would not be possible. For example, a community organizer who worked in the Pueblo Del Rio public housing
            complex told us that residents had years ago convened walkthroughs with city officials to recommend some of the same
            proposals for crosswalks and curb cuts that now show up in LAPD&rsquo;s new CPTED assessments. At the time these
            proposals were denied or ignored, with city officials citing costs or other excuses. But now LAPD sweeps in to propose
            delivering these same solutions via the institution of policing. This dynamic of &ldquo;community policing&rdquo;
            programs holding communities hostage by offering vital resources and services that the city otherwise denies is
            examined in more detail in part 6 of this report. </p>

              <u class="anchor report-section-title" id="Citywide-Nuisance-Abatement-Program">Citywide Nuisance Abatement Program</u>
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>What is known today as the Citywide Nuisance Abatement Program (CNAP) is an extension of a decades-long history and
            evolution of nuisance abatement laws and programs. CNAP targets buildings identified by LAPD to target for nuisance
            abatement actions. These enforcement actions aim to coerce the owners of the property to make significant changes to
            the property that further the LAPD&rsquo;s surveillance programs and often displace tenants in the building, which can
            break up communities and fuel gentrification of the area.</p>
          <p>CNAP is staffed by five core agencies: LAPD, the City Attorney, the Department of Building and Safety, the Planning
            Department, and the Housing Department. Three of these agencies (LAPD, the City Attorney, and the Department of
            Building and Safety) had worked together since 1990 through the FALCON (Focused Attack Linking Community Organizations
            and Neighborhoods) Narcotics Abatement Unit, funded by federal grants. FALCON expanded on a previous city abatement
            program that relied on the Uniform Controlled Substances Act of 1972 and California Health and Safety Code dealing
            specifically with narcotics abatement. Those laws were, in turn, an extension of the Red Light Abatement of 1953. <a
              class="anchor" id="_ftn83" href="#_ftnref83">
              <sup>
                <sup>[83]</sup>
              </sup>
            </a>
          </p>
          <p>Today, CNAP enforcement operates through data-sharing between the city agencies who run the program along with
            whatever stakeholders and private interests these agencies each engage. LAPD works to criminalize, track, and surveil
            residents. This data goes to the City Attorney, which can open an investigation and then send a demand letter or meet
            with the property owner to discuss changes to the building. <a class="anchor" id="_ftn84" href="#_ftnref84">
              <sup>
                <sup>[84]</sup>
              </sup>
            </a> If the City Attorney determines the landlord or property owner is compliant with their proposals, then the
            building has &ldquo;self-abated.&rdquo; But if the City Attorney is unsatisfied, then they can file a nuisance
            abatement lawsuit against the building in state court. </p>
          <p>Much of CNAP&rsquo;s coercion occurs without a lawsuit ever being filed. Between 2018 and 2019, the City Attorney
            opened 479 nuisance case files but only filed 30 lawsuits. <a class="anchor" id="_ftn85" href="#_ftnref85">
              <sup>
                <sup>[85]</sup>
              </sup>
            </a> Once a building is targeted for this kind of investigation, it can be subject to random inspections for
            compliance with municipal codes or become subject to other rules, restrictions, and changes requested by police. CNAP
            can also be used to make threats about a building&rsquo;s conditional use permits, which can exercise extreme leverage
            over commercial properties that need those permits to operate. The Planning Department can also initiate
            administrative Nuisance Abatement proceedings to enforce municipal codes. This enforcement extends policing powers to
            non-police entities, expanding the city&rsquo;s ability to police vulnerable communities. </p>
          <p>Nuisance abatement allows police and developers to strategically banish residents or businesses whose buildings are
            targets for gentrification. The evidence of criminal activity used to target properties can be highly vague, and the
            CNAP process lacks even the minimal transparency that occurs with criminal prosecutions. Details of the
            &ldquo;criminal activity&rdquo; used to target properties are not made public, and most abatement efforts settle
            without litigation, which means the city rarely advances or defends evidence before a court. <a class="anchor"
              id="_ftn86" href="#_ftnref86">
              <sup>
                <sup>[86]</sup>
              </sup>
            </a>
          </p>
          <p>Although CNAP enforcement against a building can originate with information from police, politicians, neighbors, and
            property owners, the program is driven by LAPD allegations more than any other source. According to emails obtained
            through the PRA, a Deputy City Attorney (DCA) noted in 2019 that regardless of the source of a referral, an LAPD
            &ldquo;gang officer&rsquo;s communication would be sufficient for the DCA to open a case on the property.&rdquo; <a
              class="anchor" id="_ftn87" href="#_ftnref87">
              <sup>
                <sup>[87]</sup>
              </sup>
            </a> This is where data-driven policing&rsquo;s role becomes apparent. Coercion, targeting, and displacement through
            CNAP were one of the &ldquo;strategies&rdquo; that officers were trained to use for Operation LASER&rsquo;s Anchor
            Points, along with &ldquo;licensing/conditional use permits,&rdquo; another element of CNAP coercion. <a
              class="anchor" id="_ftn88" href="#_ftnref88">
              <sup>
                <sup>[88]</sup>
              </sup>
            </a> And as we explain in part 3, CNAP prosecutors used LASER data to determine enforcement priorities. Part 3 also
            looks at how developers use CNAP to displace local businesses. Further, our discussion of data-driving policing in
            Skid Row in part 4 reveals how locations targeted as Anchor Points were key sites of displacement. </p>
          <p>Not only is CNAP another way the city weaponizes police data, it also helps expand LAPD&rsquo;s surveillance
            architecture. The City Attorney uses CNAP to require that residential landlords allow for LAPD walkthroughs and
            patrols as well as warrantless and keyless 24/7 access. CNAP prosecutors have also required buildings to hire private
            security who coordinate with police to screen visitors and check identification, excluding and banishing
            people&rsquo;s family and associates, as well as enforce coercive rules on how people can spend time or gather in
            common areas. For residents, all of this can amount to a takeover of their homes by police, bringing the violence of
            &ldquo;broken windows&rdquo; policing and stop-and-frisk right onto people&rsquo;s doorsteps, all under the threat of
            eviction.</p>
          <p>Sometimes CNAP enforcement can require installation of CCTV cameras and other LAPD surveillance infrastructure. In
            part 3 below, we discuss an example of CNAP targeting a business in the rapidly gentrifying neighborhood of West
            Adams, closely coordinated with a real estate firm that was trying to buy the building that the business occupied.
            Along the same lines, the CNAP lawsuit filed against the owner of the Chesapeake Apartments, a 425-unit complex spread
            out across 17 acres in Baldwin Village, asked the judge to order &ldquo;the establishment of extensive security
            systems at the property with direct access by the Los Angeles Police Department to these systems of monitoring and
            surveillance.&rdquo; <a class="anchor" id="_ftn89" href="#_ftnref89">
              <sup>
                <sup>[89]</sup>
              </sup>
            </a> These CNAP-compelled surveillance systems expand LAPD&rsquo;s vast architecture of surveillance, which includes
            fusion centers, facial recognition, and other data-mining initiatives. The lawsuit also demanded that the landlord
            implement &ldquo;improved tenant screening and lease enforcement procedures&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;armed, licensed
            security guards.&rdquo; <a class="anchor" id="_ftn90" href="#_ftnref90">

            </a>
          </p>
          <p>Just as the Chesapeake Apartments CNAP lawsuit helped expand LAPD&rsquo;s surveillance and data-mining powers, the
            buildup to the case featured data-driven policing. Below is an LAPD mission sheet generated through the Palantir
            data-mining platform one week prior to the CNAP case being filed. The City Attorney describes the apartment complex as
            an "alleged stronghold for the Black P-Stones street gang," and LAPD&rsquo;s mission sheet directs police to target
            "BPS gang areas,&rdquo; even specifying that "heavy pedestrian and traffic enforcement on gang members belonging to
            this gang is encouraged." <a class="anchor" id="_ftn91" href="#_ftnref91">
              <sup>
                <sup>[91]</sup>
              </sup>
            </a> The recap lists 105 police stops, 21 arrests, and 8 field interview cards during a one week period. </p>

        <div class="paragraph-container">
          <p>LAPD&rsquo;s links to CNAP show how data-driven policing directly plugs police into enforcement of property laws,
            multiplying LAPD&rsquo;s powers of banishment and displacement. Beyond programs like LASER, nuisance abatement is
            increasingly being coordinated and automated using centralized data systems. For example, City Council in 2017 enacted
            a motion presented by council members Joe Buscaino and Bob Blumenfield directing the agencies that comprise CNAP to
            improve the tracking and information sharing on these properties through &ldquo;the use of shared databases and other
            technological tools to assist in the tracking of these properties.&rdquo; <a class="anchor" id="_ftn92"
              href="#_ftnref92">
              <sup>
                <sup>[92]</sup>
              </sup>
            </a> The motion also invited LAPD to create &ldquo;additional training on identifying and tracking nuisance
            properties.&rdquo; </p>
          <p>In all these examples, CNAP is another way the city uses policing and police data to coordinate displacement and
            racialized banishment. These practices are expanding to become more automated with the growth of data-driven policing.
            In part 3 of the report, we dive into different examples of how CNAP and the other policing programs and tactics
            introduced in this part enable coordination, collusion, and affinity between police and real estate developers.</p>

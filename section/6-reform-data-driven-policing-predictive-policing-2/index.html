            <p>The
            final part of this report looks at three reformist strategies for obscuring, accepting, and broadening the violence
            data-driven policing: (1) reframing &ldquo;predictive policing&rdquo; systems as &ldquo;using data for police
            accountability,&rdquo; (2) standardizing the use of these systems using surveillance bureaucracy, and (3) combining
            data-driven policing with &ldquo;community policing&rdquo; programs that draw from counterinsurgency tactics to
            contain and control people.</p><p>In April 2019, LAPD announced it would end Operation LASER, with <span
              style="color: #222222;"> LAPD chief Michel Moore admitting that the program was an &ldquo;experiment.&rdquo; <a

              </a>
            </span>A year later, in April 2020, LAPD discontinued use of PredPol. That same month, Chief Moore announced
            <strong>Data-Informed Community-Focused Policing</strong>, a new data-driven policing framework that combines mass
            data collection and algorithms with &ldquo;community policing&rdquo; &ldquo;procedural justice&rdquo; and
            &ldquo;data-informed&rdquo; police &ldquo;accountability.&rdquo; <a class="anchor" id="_ftn280" href="#_ftnref280">
              <sup>
                <sup>[280]</sup>
              </sup>
            </a> T <span style="color: #222222;">he LAPD document introducing </span>Data-Informed Community-Focused Policing
            proclaimed: &ldquo;As part of our ongoing effort to improve the Department and the service we provide, we will
            continue to implement systems that measure results, improve efficiency, and provide overall
            accountability.&rdquo;</p><p>Those reformist notions of &ldquo;accountability&rdquo;
            &ldquo;efficiency&rdquo; and &ldquo;community policing&rdquo; are not what the communities who worked to end
            predictive policing fought for. We demanded abolition. But policing exists within an ecology where institutions
            devoted to &ldquo;reforming&rdquo; police marginalize community voices. To abolish data-driven policing, we need to
            examine the work of these institutions. Indeed, just as LAPD is currently drawing from the police reform
            industry&rsquo;s work to &ldquo;reform&rdquo; data-driven policing, LAPD&rsquo;s first-generation predictive policing
            technologies were once promoted by that industry as reform as well.</p><p>When LASER and PredPol first
            launched, &ldquo;predictive&rdquo; policing was seen by police reformers as an exciting new trend, with advocacy
            nonprofits like the New York-based Vera Institute for Justice using that term to promote LAPD&rsquo;s work. Vera
            &ndash;&nbsp;which opened an office in L.A. in 2011 that is now very active in bail and pretrial justice reform
            &ndash;&nbsp;has long been a pioneer of developing pretrial risk assessment tools, which operate similarly to
            predictive policing technologies to arm judges and lawyers with numerical scores to determine who to cage and how to
            set bail. <a class="anchor" id="_ftn281" href="#_ftnref281">

                <sup>[281]</sup>
              </sup>
            </a></p><p>In 2014, Vera and the Bureau of Justice Assistance &ndash;&nbsp;the same federal agency
            that Los Angeles CNAP prosecutors worked with in 2009 published their report promoting novel uses of nuisance
            abatement lawsuits &ndash;&nbsp;collaborated on a report titled &ldquo;Putting a Value on Crime Analysts:
            Considerations for Law Enforcement Executives.&rdquo; The report urged police across the country to adopt &ldquo;data
            driven&rdquo; policing tactics, describing &ldquo;predictive policing&rdquo; as an important new
            &ldquo;paradigm&rdquo; and highlighting Operation LASER as &ldquo;an example&rdquo; of this trend. <a class="anchor"
              id="_ftn282" href="#_ftnref282">
              <sup>
                <sup>[282]</sup>
              </sup>
            </a> The report called on police departments to adopt &ldquo;data-driven strategies such as hot-spot policing,
            problem-oriented policing, and intelligence-led policing,&rdquo; even advertising the role of Palantir and Craig
            Uchida&rsquo;s JSS firm in persuading LAPD to expand LASER:</p><p>LASER illustrates the relationship
            between operational and strategic crime analysis, and highlights the possibilities for collaboration in crime
            analysis. CID created hot-spots and offender bulletins with the aid of a private firm&rsquo;s software (Palantir),
            while a consulting firm (Justice &amp; Security Strategies) provided the impact analysis, which persuaded the Los
            Angeles Police Department to expand the program to four other divisions.</p><p>As the community worked to
            organize against LASER&rsquo;s violence, LAPD pointed to Vera&rsquo;s report as evidence that the program should be
            preserved. Eventually we won the day, forcing an end to both LASER and PredPol. But the evolution of those programs
            into today&rsquo;s Data-Informed Community-Focused policing shows the need to organize not only against police tactics
            and programs but also against the nonprofit, academic, and industrial ecosystems that have always helped policing
            build and rebuild in response to community criticism.</p><p>The rest of this section focuses on three
            reformist strategies being used to build the next generation of data-driven policing: (1) reframing &ldquo;predictive
            policing&rdquo; systems as &ldquo;using data for police accountability,&rdquo; a notion that has been promoted by
            police reformers as &ldquo; <strong>Predictive Policing 2.0</strong>&rdquo; (2) standardizing the use of these systems
            using legal criteria and transparency requirements, an approach we call <strong>surveillance bureaucracy</strong>, and
            (3) combining data-driven policing with <strong>&ldquo;community policing&rdquo; </strong>programs that draw from
            counterinsurgency tactics to contain and control people.</p><p style="text-align: center;">
            <strong>
              <u class="anchor report-section-title" id="predictive-policing-2">&ldquo;Predictive Policing 2.0&rdquo;</u>
            </strong>
          </p><p>Once the community toppled LAPD&rsquo;s racist notion of "predictive policing,&rdquo; police grabbed for
            new reformist concepts to regain their footing. LAPD&rsquo;s new spin on data-driven policing&nbsp;is the language of
            making policing more transparent, efficient, and &ldquo;accountable.&rdquo; In other words, now the police pretense
            for gathering and manipulating mass data harvested through LAPD&rsquo;s systems &ndash; including the Palantir
            infrastructure that continues to manage LAPD&rsquo;s data even without the LASER and PredPol &ldquo;predictive&rdquo;
            layers &ndash; will be &ldquo;transparency&rdquo; and the need to measure &ldquo;fairness,&rdquo;
            &ldquo;accuracy,&rdquo; and &ldquo;effectiveness.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Data-Informed Community-Focused
            Policing <span style="color: #222222;"> even repackages and expands on Operation LASER, literally even renaming some
              LASER&rsquo;s components. For example, according to LAPD&rsquo;s internal &ldquo;Daily Operations Guide&rdquo; for
              the program that we obtained through a recent PRA, the &ldquo;Crime Analysis Detail&rdquo; that generated Operation
              LASER&rsquo;s Chronic Offender Bulletin hit lists &ldquo;has been renamed to the new titled Area Crime &amp;
              Community Intelligence Centers (ACCIC).&rdquo; <a class="anchor" id="_ftn283" href="#_ftnref283">

                  </sup>
                </sup>
              </a> And the SARA (Scanning, Analysis, Response, Response) model at the core of Operation LASER was renamed as CAPRA
              (Clients, Acquiring and Analyzing Information, Partnerships, Response, and Assessment), a rebranding that had been
              recommended years earlier by the RAND Corporation. <a class="anchor" id="_ftn284" href="#_ftnref284">

            <p>Soon after LAPD replaced LASER and PredPol of Data-Informed Community-Focused
            Policing, the PredPol company undertook a nearly identical rebranding. In March 2021 the company announced that it was
            changing its name to Geolitica. The headline on their website changed to: &ldquo;We run operations for public safety
            teams to be more transparent, accountable, and effective.&rdquo; Their twitter bio appended #CommunityPolicing to the
            end of that same sentence. And echoing LAPD&rsquo;s April 2020 substitution of PredPol with &ldquo;Data-Driven
            Community Informed Policing,&rdquo; the background banner on Geolitica's twitter page was changed from &ldquo;The
            Predictive Policing Company&trade;&rdquo; to &ldquo;Data-Driven Community Policing.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>These rebranding
            maneuvers &ndash; turning &ldquo;predictive policing&rdquo; into using data to make police &ldquo;transparent,
            accountable, and effective&rdquo; &ndash; are strategies to make policing more durable. Whether via the original
            endeavor of &ldquo;predicting&rdquo; crime or today&rsquo;s new framing, LAPD will continue to collect data to control
            and harm our people. The surveillance inputs, Palantir data processing systems, and policing outputs remain the same.
            In fact, replacing the discredited notion of &ldquo;predictive policing&rdquo; with the reformist footing of
            &ldquo;police accountability&rdquo; and &ldquo;community&rdquo; makes these systems more difficult to dismantle.</p>
          <p>These rebrandings didn&rsquo;t come out of nowhere. Police reform professionals had been advocating for a
            new phase of &ldquo;predictive policing&rdquo; for years. In summer 2020, we filed PRA requests with LAPD seeking
            their communications with academics who seemed complicit in efforts to expand data-driven policing. One of these
            academics was Andrew Ferguson, a law professor who wrote a book on data-driven policing. <a class="anchor"

            </a> In one of the emails we obtained, Ferguson writes the following&nbsp;to LAPD Deputy Chief Sean Malinowski in May
            2019, just after Malinowski announced he would be leaving LAPD to work in the private and academic sectors:
            &ldquo;When you leave LAPD can we chat for a bit? I have a suggestion about how I think you should approach predictive
            policing 2.0 in the private sector.&rdquo; <a class="anchor" id="_ftn286" href="#_ftnref286">

            </a> Ferguson went on to warn him about the criticism PredPol&rsquo;s founder Jeff Brantingham (the UCLA professor)
            had faced, noting it "is bad for business and consulting." He explained that, &ldquo;I think PredPol misread the
            sentiment about how to think about predictive policing and didn&rsquo;t pivot to a more police accountability focus in
            time."&nbsp;</p><p>Ferguson even offered this same rebranding advice to the companies that sell
            predictive policing technologies. Public records show Ferguson emailing the product manager of HunchLab &ndash;&nbsp;a
            Philadelphia-based &ldquo;predictive policing&rdquo; business &ndash; in January 2018 with the &ldquo;hypothetical
            question&rdquo; of what they would do if &ldquo;a city came to you and said, we are interested in using HunchLab
            technology primarily to improve police accountability.&rdquo; <a class="anchor" id="_ftn288" href="#_ftnref288">
              <sup>
                <sup>[288]</sup>
              </sup>
            </a> After the HunchLab product manager replied, Ferguson shared that he recently &ldquo;found myself in the odd
            position of promoting HunchLab&rsquo;s capabilities and insights&rdquo; and noted &ldquo;the potential bad press of
            predictive policing.&rdquo; He reiterated his rebranding proposal, asking: &ldquo;Have you guys thought about spinning
            out a new product (not predictive policing) but branded solely for police accountability?&rdquo;</p>
          <p>The HunchLab manager agreed that &ldquo;[p]redictive policing has been increasingly vilified,&rdquo; but he
            didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;think that a tool that incorporates produced harms to better manage patrols&rdquo;
            &ndash;&nbsp;i.e., the &ldquo;data for police accountability&rdquo; branding that Ferguson proposed &ndash; &ldquo;can
            exist without the crime prediction.&rdquo; Ferguson quickly responded that the solution could be selling two products:
            &ldquo;what if you said, look we have our patrol management system, but we also have another product for those
            departments that are concerned with police accountability over crime reduction.&rdquo; But, he added, the two products
            don&rsquo;t need to be any different functionally, only marketed in different ways: &ldquo;both systems would have
            both crime prediction and patrol management, but it would be just pitched differently.&rdquo; This would, Ferguson
            explained, benefit a police chief who fears &ldquo;if I buy a predictive policing patrol management system I am going
            to get grief by everyone from the ACLU to the community (because the bloom is off the rose of predictive
            analytics).&rdquo; But if the system is simply marketed differently, then that police chief &ldquo;will get credit
            from the community of caring about police accountability and won't have to deal with the predictive policing
            backlash.&rdquo;</p><p>Our PRA requests to UCLA seeking Jeff Brantingham&rsquo;s communications later
            revealed Ferguson advising the PredPol founder too. An April 2019 email from Ferguson to Brantingham begins:
            &ldquo;Just wanted you to know that I am sorry that all of this negativity is being directed at you personally,&rdquo;
            and &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t think it is fair to target you, or your academic affiliation, or anything but your
            ideas.&rdquo; <a class="anchor" id="_ftn289" href="#_ftnref289">
              <sup>
                <sup>[289]</sup>
              </sup>
            </a> Of course, Brantingham&rsquo;s name, face, and academic affiliation were constantly used by both LAPD and PredPol
            to promote the technology. Next in the email comes Ferguson&rsquo;s advice: &ldquo;you should promote your papers
            showing that you can balance race or other factors as a technical matter and it is all about how the police (not the
            companies) choose to calibrate the algorithm.&rdquo; Ferguson&rsquo;s point seems to be: companies like PredPol
            shouldn&rsquo;t be blamed for the racial terror that police use their products for, since those stem from how police
            &ldquo;choose to calibrate the algorithm.&rdquo; But as we&rsquo;ve seen in Skid Row, this is precisely the problem:
            police calibrate these algorithms however they please, while citing the academic affiliation and origins of the
            systems to claim their violence is scientific.</p><p>Ferguson later published an academic article on
            his idea of rebranding &ldquo;predictive policing&rdquo; as an &ldquo;accountability&rdquo; platform, asking
            &ldquo;whether the same big data policing technologies built to track movements, actions, and patterns of criminal
            activity could be redesigned to foster data-driven police accountability.&rdquo; <a class="anchor" id="_ftn290"

            </a> He also forwarded his emails with HunchLab to Chief Malinowski, which is why we were able to obtain them through
            PRA requests. In October 2018, a few months after those emails, HunchLab was bought by ShotSpotter, a company selling
            &ldquo;gunshot detection&rdquo; systems that consist of microphone networks that dispatch police to locations where a

            Community-Focused Policing represent the Predictive Policing 2.0 that police departments and police reformers have
            been looking for.</p><p style="text-align: center;">

            </strong>
          </p><p>In addition to the evolution into Predictive Policing 2.0, another way predictive policing has been
            &ldquo;reformed&rdquo; is through what we call <strong>surveillance bureaucracy</strong>. In 2020, we published a
            pamphlet titled <u>Fuck the Police, Trust the People: Surveillance Bureaucracy Expands the Stalker State</u>. <a

                </span>
              </sup>
            </a> These surveillance bureaucracy efforts are the other side of the coin of reform. While some police reformers work
            to promote new policing innovations, as discussed in the prior section, others create the legal framework for
            acceptance, approval, and normalization of these technologies over time.</p><p>Even when framed as
            critical of these technologies, these reformist approaches accept that the technology is necessary or inevitable, just
            used excessively, incorrectly, or in a concerning manner. For example, in 2016,&nbsp;a collection of advocacy
            nonprofits led by the ACLU addressed &ldquo;predictive policing&rdquo; with a &ldquo;Statement of Concern&rdquo;
            calling for &ldquo;continuous assessment,&rdquo; proposed &ldquo;tracking&rdquo; the &ldquo;demographics of the people
            involved,&rdquo; and encouraged governing these harms through legal notions like &ldquo;due process.&rdquo; <a
              class="anchor" id="_ftn298" href="#_ftnref298">
              <sup>
                <sup>[298]</sup>
              </sup>
            </a>&nbsp; This statement was issued during a crucial time for the development of predictive policing programs, as
            well as our efforts to dismantle this violence.</p><p>Advocacy like this can be harmful to
            abolitionist movement-building. No matter the intent, academics and nonprofits who limit their criticisms of
            data-driven policing to the details and call for the reform of these practices buy into the racist premise that there
            are people whose policing can be scientifically or objectively justified. Regulations governing transparency,
            oversight, and auditing of predictive policing also allow police to claim official approval for their violence, so
            long as they followed the procedural steps. Even when reformers say predictive policing should be outright eliminated,
            there comes the question: what are they seeking instead? If they aren't committed to police abolition, then do they
            just want police to use old-fashioned subjective racism?</p><p>These fights are not theoretical. The stakes
            are everyday banishment, brutalization, and killing of our people. And we are surrounded by well-funded efforts to
            institutionalize use of the same predictive policing we have been fighting to dismantle. For example, last year the
            ACLU of Northern California <a href="https://action.aclu.org/petition/cn-santa-cruz-surveillance-petition">led a
              campaign</a> to "ban" predictive policing in Santa Cruz, which was one of the first cities to experiment with
            predictive policing and is also where PredPol is headquartered. <a class="anchor" id="_ftn299" href="#_ftnref299">

            </a> Santa Cruz police had ended their predictive policing program in 2017, but last year the ACLU gathered a
            coalition of groups to enact an ordinance that they celebrated as a "ban" on the program. This is how ACLU lawyers as
            well as news headlines referred to the ordinance. But a quick look at the ordinance&rsquo;s etxt reveals that police
            are authorized to use these tools upon &ldquo;the city council&rsquo;s finding that the data that informs the
            technology meets scientifically validated and peer reviewed research." <a class="anchor" id="_ftn300"

            <span style="color: #222222;"> titled "Santa Cruz becomes the first U.S. city to ban predictive policing" notes that

              didn&rsquo;t hear a single speaker oppose the initiative.&rdquo; If the reason no one objects to your predictive
              policing ordinance is that police and PredPol both support it, then the harm of that ordinance ought to be clear as
              day. </span>
          </p><p>
            <span style="color: #222222;">This Santa Cruz example illustrates how reform, industrial, and academic forces can
              combine to make harmful policing more durable, as well as helping it spread. </span>Put simply, t <span
              style="color: #222222;">he ACLU, PredPol, and local police collaboratively used legal tools and &ldquo;democratic
              process&rdquo; to get the community behind an ordinance that codified predictive policing. As soon as the law was
              enacted, PredPol declared that their tool will meet the approval criteria. HunchLab/ShotSpotter (another predictive
              policing company) have also said they expect to meet the criteria, and Palantir is reportedly working on the same.
              If those companies win this approval from Santa Cruz&rsquo;s City Council, they can go around the country saying
              their harmful tools were approved under rules the ACLU championed.</span>
          </p><p>That experience of Santa Cruz also hints at the legacy of colonization and colonial governance. The ACLU
            ordinance lists criteria for approval of predictive policing to be voted on by the local City Council, which has
            become Republican-controlled as part of the city&rsquo;s recent demographic shift into a wealthy white enclave not far
            from Silicon Valley. Those constituents will no doubt need to use policing to maintain their control of the land, to
            clear more properties for their benefit, and to enforce the &ldquo;security&rdquo; their rule has always required.
            This is what the process of conquest has always been about.</p><p>The role of reformers in this evolution is
            to supply police with concepts and structures that they can use to sanitize or defend their violence. In this way,
            reform is a process not just of expanding police but also suppressing resistance. This too is part of the long history
            of occupation and domination. When violent force and removal are considered unsavory, occupying forces employ
            counterinsurgency tactics, which can range from &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; gathering to &ldquo;winning hearts and
            minds.&rdquo; Ideological and technical exchange between the military and police agencies are not only evident in the

            <p>LAPD&rsquo;s marriage of &ldquo;community&rdquo; and &ldquo;data-driven&rdquo; policing in the
            Data-Informed Community-Focused Policing program today is part of a strategy of counterinsurgency. Both
            &ldquo;community&rdquo; and &ldquo;data-driven&rdquo; policing are the current era&rsquo;s prevailing police reform
            trends, and they help complement and secure assent for police violence. As noted in a profile about Bill
            Bratton&rsquo;s views on predictive policing and the impact on policing practices nationally, &ldquo;Predictive
            policing relies crucially on community engagement&mdash;it can work only when the police are seen as part of the

          <p>Proposals for &ldquo;community policing&rdquo; are typically loudest after mass mobilization against police violence,
            moments when people are trying to take power away from police. As the quotes at the top of this section show, these
            strategies all but literally take a page out of the Army Counterinsurgency Field Manual, which was written to instruct

            violence in our communities, ethnically cleansing land and enforcing exploitation and resource extraction, while also
            attempting to maintain the veneer of legitimacy in order to subdue resistance.</p><p>While the
            tactics are as old as policing itself, the term &ldquo;community policing&rdquo; began to be used in the 1970s to
            address the police&rsquo;s &ldquo;public relations problem&rdquo; after violent repression of the anti-war and civil
            rights movements. Using the U.S. DOJ&rsquo;s definition of community policing, PredPol &ndash;&nbsp;which in March
            2021 rebranded as a &ldquo;#CommunityPolicing&rdquo; company &ndash; says the term refers to a &ldquo;proactive style

            </a></p><p>The overall objective of &ldquo;community policing&rdquo; is embedding police deep into
            communities, where they recruit ambassadors and informants, collect data on neighborhood relationships, spread
            propaganda about their work, and offer resources that people have otherwise been denied. The basic premise of
            community policing is that embedding police in neighborhood relationships as well as using them to deliver vital
            social services will help people perceive police as part of the community rather than a violent force. The ultimate
            goal is to pacify criticism of police and secure assent for police terror, a parallel to how the U.S. military&rsquo;s
            counterinsurgency tactics serve to provide political cover for violent imperialism and occupation.</p><p

            which first formed in 2011 as a police force within public housing residences managed by the city&rsquo;s public
            housing agency, HACLA. Today the program continues to sap vital HACLA funding, which is slated to
            &ldquo;reimburse&rdquo; LAPD around $8.75 million for the five-year period running from January 2021 through December
            2025. Residents of the HACLA complexes where CSP was first deployed describe it as yet another campaign of racial
            terror by police, turning public housing buildings into penal colonies. Jaime Zeledon, who lived in the Jordan Downs

            &ldquo;strongly agree&rdquo;) that LAPD does not &ldquo;treat people of all races and ethnicities fairly,&rdquo; a

            </a> For LAPD, this widespread distrust and aversion to violent, racist policing is simply a false
            &ldquo;perception.&rdquo; This is the mentality of the abuser, telling people hunted by police that they misunderstand
            what they&rsquo;re experiencing. If you speak to people actually experiencing this abuse, they know exactly what it
            is. A letter written by Margaret Totty, who managed a portion of the redevelopment of the Jordan Downs HACLA complex
            and through that work became &ldquo;familiar with several officers within the Community Safety Partnership group of

            solution was not ending police terror but &ldquo;changing that perception,&rdquo; and according to Uchida, two
            &ldquo;programs&rdquo; with &ldquo;demonstrated success&rdquo; on that front were &ldquo;Community Safety Partnership
            program and Collective Efficacy.&rdquo; This term &ldquo;collective efficacy&rdquo; is one that LAPD and its partners
            frequently use to describe partnerships between police and &ldquo;stakeholders&rdquo; invested in policing. As Uchida
            has described, collective efficacy entails &ldquo;watching out for other people and their property&rdquo; and

          </p><p>Just a month after the George Floyd uprising last summer, Mayor Garcetti and LAPD announced that the CSP
            program would be expanded into a full LAPD bureau. Joining Garcetti at the press conference to make this announcement
            was Advancement Project co-founder Connie Rice, who proclaimed: &ldquo;The CSP Bureau is a serious commitment to the
            vision of guardian partners as the future mindset of American policing. Guardian policing is the path to ending the
            warrior culture of impunity that millions are marching to end.&rdquo; In reality of course, the slogans on the street
            were predominantly &ldquo;fuck the police&rdquo; and &ldquo;defund the police,&rdquo; not &ldquo;guardian
            policing.&rdquo; But Rice is an example of community &ldquo;leaders&rdquo; propped up by police to promote an
            institution that has always been used for racial terror, usually at the moments the communities are most loudly naming
            the violent reality of policing.</p><p>In 2016, Connie Rice and LAPD chief Charlie Beck &ndash; under whose
            tenure LAPD killed more people than any police force in the country &ndash;&nbsp;wrote an op-ed titled &ldquo;How
            Community Policing Can Work.&rdquo; <a class="anchor" id="_ftn314" href="#_ftnref314">

            </a> The op-ed was framed as a response to the latest spectacular police killings of Black people, referencing in its
            first sentence &ldquo;the shooting deaths of black men like Alton B. Sterling and Philando Castile&rdquo; (note how
            &ldquo;shooting deaths&rdquo; is phrased as though the men simply died, not that they were killed, unlike the
            op-ed&rsquo;s reference to &ldquo;recent <em>murders</em> of police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge&rdquo;). From
            there the authors went on to promote &ldquo;guardian policing.&rdquo;</p><p>Nonsense proposals like
            &ldquo;guardian policing&rdquo; are the common ground that police leaders and police reformers always rush to during
            rebellions. A week after the George Floyd rebellion, Rice took to the L.A. Times with another op-ed pushing this very

            instead of addressing the roots of the community&rsquo;s outrage. Time and again, this cycle has served to expand LAPD

            years of salary for officers who were required by COPS to have spent at least &ldquo;180 consecutive days of active
            military duty post September 11, 2001.&rdquo; LAPD deployed these former troops &ndash;&nbsp;many of them fresh from
            occupying Iraq and Afghanistan &ndash;&nbsp;solely to CSP programs in public housing developments. Adopting the
            language of foreign deployments, LAPD said these troops were the &ldquo;primary LAPD ambassadors to the residents and
            are intimately involved in all community activities and concerns, as well as monitor [sic] and control criminal

            Group,&nbsp;run by the billionaire owner of the L.A. Clippers as well as a massive new sports complex near SoFi
            stadium. Ballmer&rsquo;s grants paid for three years of funding for officers to join the CSP program. According to
            LAPD&rsquo;s 2020 budget, &ldquo;the Ballmer Foundation stipulated that any site it supported in its infancy would

            deliberate underdevelopment, organized abandonment, and racial capitalism that we see in communities like Skid Row and
            South Central. Time and again, the state ignores and exacerbates the structural issues that create what it governs as
            &ldquo;crime&rdquo; &ndash; including intergenerational poverty, systemic racism, and housing insecurity, all of which
            are an inevitable and intended result of a violent settler state that survives by controlling land and either
            banishing or exploiting the people who live on that land. Instead of ever undoing or ending that violence, community
            policing secures more violence as the &ldquo;solution,&rdquo; responding to structural violence only through the
            police budget and violent force.</p><p>This cycle of violence is not an accident. It is the fundamental
            purpose of policing, part of the logic of conquest that spans the settler state&rsquo;s entire history. The myth of
            benevolent community policing is a way to cloak that reality and undermine organized resistance to it.</p>
